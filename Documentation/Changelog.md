#### Changelog for HockeySDK-Android 5.0.4

This version contains a few bugfixes as well as the removal of an API that has been deprecated since HockeySDK 3.7.0-Beta.2.

* **Removal of deprecated API** `ExceptionHandler.saveException(Throwable exception, CrashManagerListener listener)` has been deprecated since 3.7.0-beta.2. Use `ExceptionHandler.saveException(Throwable exception, Thread thread, CrashManagerListener listener)` instead.
* **Bugfix** The SDK now deletes redundant crash reports.
* **Bugfix** The SDK does no longer send the event that indicates the start of a session twice but once. There was no impact on session counts as the event was de-duplicated on the server.
* **Bugfix** Fixes a potential deadlock when reading device information when saving an exception.
* **Bugfix** Fixes a potential NPE when processing stacktraces. Thanks to [Thomas Reis for reporting issue #331](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Android/issues/331).

#### Changelog for HockeySDK-Android 5.0.3

This release now limits the number of crashes that are stored by the SDK while the device is offline to 100 Crashes. HockeySDK-Android will stop to collect crashes until the number of unsent crashes drops below the limit of 100 unsent crashes.

* [BUGFIX] Fixes a possible `OutOfMemoryError` exception. This only occurs when a very large number of crashes – several 100k or more – wasn't sent to the server. [#313](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Android/pull/313)


### 5.0.0

Upgrade to HockeySDK for Android 5.0.2.

This release comes with one major breaking change. HockeySDK 5.0.0 raises the minimum API level to 15.
In addition, we no longer support restricting builds by device id. The reason is that, with Android O, `ANDROID_ID` no longer ensures a consistent way of identification of a user.

To be ready for Android O, HockeySDK-Android now limits the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission with the `maxSdkVersion` filter. In some use cases, e.g. where an app contains a dependency that requires this permission, `maxSdkVersion` makes it impossible for those dependencies to grant or request the permission. The solution for those cases is to declare the `tools:node="replace"` manifest merging strategy later in the dependency tree:

```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" tools:node="replace"/>```
